<h1>PROCESS</h1>
<p>Our tuning process is entirely non-invasive. Through the OBDII port, we attach the Armytrix control module, through which we upload the software upgrades to the ECU. Meaning no ripping out the engine control unit, no chip implanting, no messy wirings; all we do is Plug-n-Install. We aim to get your vehicle out of the garage and back onto the road as fast as possible. Smooth and progressive power, with improved response, that can be tailored to your requirements. </p>

</br> <h1>POWER TUNE & ECO TUNE</h1>
<p>There are TWO different tuning paths you can take, POWER Tune or ECO Tune: </p>
<p>Like the name implies, Power Tune is all about maximizing your vehicle’s overall performance settings.

Meaning you can do the things you’ve always dreamt of doing! Fast and furious is no longer just a movie for you. </p>
<p>ECO Tune is designed to enhance engine efficiency and reduce your vehicle’s carbon footprint. By changing the parameters in the ECU, we can lower the lean-out limits, adjust air/fuel mixture, and alter ignition timing, among other interconnected elements to achieve the desire fuel saving effect. Ultimately, reducing fuel usage and increasing engine efficiency, so you can save some money and Mother Nature. If being green is the name of your game, then the Armytrix ECO Tune is for you. </p>
