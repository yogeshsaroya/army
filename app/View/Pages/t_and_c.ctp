<p class="sub_head col-sm-12" ><h2 style="text-align: center;">ARMYTRIX PRODUCTS TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2></p>


<p class="sub_head col-sm-12" ><h3>LIMITED WARRANTY & CONDITIONS</h3></p>
<p>Armytrix products are backed by a limited one (1) year warranty from the date of purchase against defects in materials and workmanship which is extended to the original purchaser of the product(s) and is not transferable. All warranty claims require the product(s) in question to be sent back to Armytrix, along with a valid proof of purchase, for a technical inspection before any replacements or repairs will be authorized. All labor and shipping costs associated with warranty claims are the responsibility of the customer. Armytrix is not liable for any additional costs or damages beyond the original purchase price of the product(s) in question. 
</p>
<p class="sub_head col-sm-12" ><h3>DISCLAIMER:</h3></p> 
<p>A. There is no warranty of sound quality or volume, as these are completely subjective characteristics. B. Not responsible for check engine light appearance. C. Wear-and-tear from under normal driving conditions, such as but limited to, discoloration, rusting, corrosion, internal deterioration, sound change D. Improper installation, inappropriate usage, resulting in damage. E. Any modification made to the product without the consent of Armytrix F. Damage caused by external impact Armytrix reserves the right to deny warrant service if it can be proved that the product in question failed or is failing due to accidental damage, external impact, abuse or misuse, track/race use, shipment, handling, storage, worn or faulty engine mounts and/or exhaust mounts, faulty location or installation, excessive vibration, internal explosion or backfire, maintenance in a manner not conforming to our instructions, modifications by persons other than ourselves, failure of a third party component, or the installation of the part(s) to a vehicle for which it was not intended. Exhaust mounts and engine mounts must be checked at least every 12 months by a qualified technician and replaced as necessary. Valid evidence of this regular service may be required in the case of a claim. Armytrix reserves the right to deny warranty replacement or repair if it is proved that a faulty engine or exhaust mount was responsible for the issue in-question. Attempted repair of a faulty Armytrix product by anyone other than Armytrix or a Armytrix agent will void this Warranty. Armytrix designs performance products for street applications which are not entirely street legal and emissions-compliant, as well as race applications which are recommended for off-road or track-use only. While most Armytrix exhaust products will pass emissions and are entirely road-legal in some countries in the EU, certain sport catalytic converters and cat-bypass pipes may not be approved in your particular region or country. Please check local laws pertaining to emissions and catalytic converters before purchasing.

<p class="sub_head col-sm-12" ><h3>PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS & AVAILABILITY</h3></p>
<p>Armytrix manufacturing specifications may vary from the diagrams and photos displayed on the website. We reserve the right to alter Armytrix product specifications without any notification. In the rare event that the price of an ordered product has changed, due to specification changes, we shall contact you to agree to a new price before accepting payment. If you do not agree to the new price, then we reserve the right to withdraw from the transaction. Armytrix products are mostly on stock if not we will always provide customers with an expected production and delivery turnaround at the time of ordering.

Any custom parts or items that receive special modification(s) due to the nature of the application, or a revision or improvement to an existing design, will usually ship upon completion. Armytrix is constantly striving to keep up with the demand for our high quality parts by trying to predict market trends and maintaining in-stock quantities, however, should a part become currently out of stock, it will be added to the fabrication queue and shipped out as soon as it becomes available.

</p>
<p class="sub_head col-sm-12" ><h3>PLEASE NOTE:</h3></p>
<p>Order cut-off times are provided as guidelines only, and do not take into account possible delays caused by payment authorization.
Estimated delivery times are to be used as a guide only and commence from the date of dispatch. We are not responsible for any delays caused by destination customs clearance processes. We are unable to redirect orders once items have been dispatched.
If you provide an email address you will be provided with delivery notification and a tracking number.
When ordering from the Armytrix site your item will arrive wrapped in one of our luxurious signature boxes. These boxes are amply sized and your items are well protected. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to email shipping@armytrix.com.
</p>
<p class="sub_head col-sm-12" ><h3>INTERNATIONAL DELIVERIES:</h3></p>
<p>Please note that all shipments may be subject to Import Duty / Tax / VAT which are levied once a shipment reaches your country.
As we have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be, additional charges for customs clearance must be paid by the recipient of the parcel. Such charges are not included in the purchase price of Armytrix products. We will not be responsible for the payment of any Import Duty / Tax / VAT under any circumstances. We are not able to offer a refund for returned goods which are returned because the customer wishes to avoid paying any customs duties imposed.
When ordering from Armytrix you agree to pay any Import Duty / Tax / VAT which may be imposed by your country's government. If you refuse to pay any Import Duty / Tax / VAT imposed and thereby prevent delivery of your order you will remain liable for the purchase price of the product/s and any Import Duty / Tax / VAT or penalty imposed by your government. Customs policies vary widely from country to country and customs duties are not always applied. Each country has its own rules for determining whether Import Duty / Tax / VAT will apply. Some countries only charge customs duties if the parcel has a value over a certain amount. Based on your country's customs rules, it is possible that your parcel will fall below that threshold level. Therefore we ask that you contact your local customs/import/mail departments for rates before you place an order to avoid any surprises.
We cannot guarantee that items will not be subject to random checks and cause associated delays and charges. Armytrix is not responsible for any delays caused by destination customs clearance processes.
